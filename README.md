# Uncommon HTML Error: Accessing Non-Existent Element Property

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in HTML that might not immediately throw an error but will lead to unexpected behavior. The error involves accessing a non-existent property of an HTML element through JavaScript.  In this case, the code attempts to access a property that doesn't exist and it doesn't throw an error, but it also doesn't assign a value as expected.

## Bug Description
The code attempts to set the value of a property `nonExistentProperty` on an HTML element which might lead to issues with code execution.
